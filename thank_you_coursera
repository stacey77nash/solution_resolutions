Thank you for your contribution to the "What is Data Science?" course. 

I am a very late bloomer. My background is in music. I have been a music educator and professional musician since earning my Bachelor's degree in Music Education in 1997. I left the teaching profession in 2008 to pursue a Master's degree in Jazz Studies, Double Bass, which I completed in 2011. Shortly afterwards, I worked for two cruise lines as a professional bassist for seven and a half years, before moving home to help with my family. Currently, I am a part-time orchestra assistant with the local school district, and I am enrolled in an online associate degree program majoring in Computer Programming Technology. 

 It has been on my bucket list for almost 20 years to learn about computer programming.  I have had a curiosity about computing since I was 9 years old and I received a TImex Sinclair for Christmas (which was later upgraded to a Commodore Vic20). I am grateful for the Coursera platform. I can learn at my own pace, and decide if I want to pursue a further learning in a program. It's a wonderful era to be an autodidact. 

Thank you for your detailed answers about the data science field. As a result of your input, I have chosen to enroll in the IBM Data Science Certificate program. Your style of imparting the information has given me the courage to believe that I can pursue a career in software engineering or data science and succeed. Thank you once again.
