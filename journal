This is a journal of my progress as learn the fundamentals of software engineering. I chose Github as my platform because I want my journal to include version control. Also, I use Github regularly, so I think that it will inspire me to write about my progress often.

I started an IBM Data Science Certificate course on October 1, 2020. What I have learned since then is that, although I am doing well on the quizzes after multiple attempts, that there is a foundational body of knowledge that I am missing that would help me in learning this vast subject. As a result, I find myself researching more about the fundamentals of computer science, and so far, it leads back to math.

Efficient code - clean coding - stems from an understanding of the theory behind the code. Math such as algorithms, linear algebra, calculus, statistics, and probability would help me on my journey.

I am only somewhat proficient in HTML and CSS. I need to learn an actual programming language, such as Python, JavaScript, Ruby, or SQL. As I go through the IBM tutorials and the SQL bootcamp (Zero to Mastery series), I am aware that learning advanced math would help my progress exponentially.

Last Friday, I changed my major from Health Information Technology to Computer Programming. As of today, October 12, the change is official. I wanted to start with Data Science, so I bought five books to help me get started.

One on building a career in data science, a Python book, a Ruby book, "The Pragmatic Programmer", and "Cracking the Code". The books are thick, and they cover a lot of material. I have decided that learning how to program is not a sprint, but a marathon. And that's okay. However long it takes, that's how long it takes.
